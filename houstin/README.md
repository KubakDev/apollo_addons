Welcome to the Home Assistant Apollo Integration! This guide will walk you through the setup process to ensure your integration runs smoothly.

## Initial Setup

Before you start using this integration, you need to prepare a few configuration files within your Home or Office environment where your Home Assistant is running. These are crucial for ensuring the integration works correctly without exposing sensitive information.

### 1. Creating `persistent_data.json`

First, create a file named `persistent1_data.json` in the `homeassistant/config` directory. This file will store persistent data needed by the integration. Here's how the file should look:

```json
{
  "isSetup": false,
  "superadminToken": ""
}
```

This file is essential for the integration to check its setup state and manage the superadmin token securely.

### 2. Configuring `secrets.yaml`

Next, you need to populate the `secrets.yaml` file with sensitive configuration and credentials. This file should also be located in the `homeassistant/config` directory. Add the following block to it:

```yaml
# //////////////////////////////////////////////////
apollo_admin:
  apolloUsername: admin
  apolloPassword: admin
  loginPath: /login
  hubName: /apollo-hub
  baseUrl: http://qwerty.example.com:1234
  supervisorSocketPath: ws://supervisor/core/websocket
  onDemandSocketPath: ws://homeassistant.local:8123/api/websocket
apollo_auth:
  client_id: http://homeassistant.local:1880/endpoint
  redirect_uri: http://homeassistant.local:1880/endpoint/auth_callback
  auth_providers_uri: http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/providers
  auth_login_flow_t: http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/login_flow
  auth_token_uri: http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/token
# /////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```

**Important:**
- The `apolloUsername` and `apolloPassword` should be generated by a superadmin or support. These credentials are extremely sensitive.
- Create an Admin User on the Apollo with the same `apolloUsername` and `apolloPassword`.
- Don't forget Apollo server baseUrl.
- **Handle with care:** Any updates pushed to this project will trigger an update to the add-on with the new configuration version.

## Usage

Once the above files are configured, you can proceed with your Apollo connection.

## Caution

Remember, it's crucial not to expose your `secrets.yaml` or `persistent_data.json` files. Do not commit these files to public repositories; always keep them secure.
